# Event-Horizon-VR
Event Horizon VR is an immersive experience in which the player is teleported onto an intergalactic spaceship as the mechanical engineer. 400 years into high-speed cruising, you are woken up from hibernation by the spaceship AI. Something is wrong with the ship and the crew’s lives depend on your actions. Will you be able to find out what’s wrong and navigate you and your crew to safety?

This is the second iteration of the project, where we transitioned away from telportation to explore zero-G locomotion.
